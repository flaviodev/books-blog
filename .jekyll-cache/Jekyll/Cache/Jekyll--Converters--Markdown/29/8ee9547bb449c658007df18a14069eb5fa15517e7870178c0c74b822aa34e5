  <li>I agree with almost everything the speaker said</li>
  <li>the speaker is an educator, so he limits the solution to school only without looking at the problem in a broader and more historical perspective</li>
  <li>education is much bigger than school</li>
  <li>it‚Äôs much more than studyning content and taking an exam</li>
  <li>education is learning, but not only in the intellectual sense, but moral, physical and spiritual</li>
  <li>it‚Äôs growing, integral development as a human being</li>
  <li>the school can‚Äôt do that, even if it wanted to</li>

      <li>the knoledge of world comes from our senses</li>
      <li>it‚Äôs impossible to pass a thought to other person</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you have a thought, and you communicate it to other person, so that person builds him thought</li>
  <li>the quality of communication will determine whether the two thoughts are similar</li>
  <li>learning is really a lonely act</li>
  <li>there‚Äôs a misconception, that learning depends on a teacher who ‚Äúteaches‚Äù you</li>
  <li>as if learning and teaching were the same thing</li>
  <li>a teacher teaches you something, and you need to study it in deep to learn</li>
  <li>but teachers actually teach for the test</li>
  <li>why are you reading this book? for the test</li>
  <li>sounds like idealism, but actually we already had it and lost</li>
  <li>the dominant educational culture has abandoned the 3R‚Äôs system and any classic teaching model</li>
